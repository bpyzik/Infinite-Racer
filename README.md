# Infinite-Racer
This is a game that a friend and I created for our game development class. I worked on the coding aspect while he did the visuals over the course of a few weeks in class. The objective of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while avoiding obstacles in the road. I created a high score system that saves the top five scores with a name. Unfortunately, this wipes every time you close the game completely but it will track the scores as long as the game stays open. You can play with your keyboard or a controller.

Note: You will need to download Construct 2 (free program) to run and it will open in chrome.
